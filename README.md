Methods Laboratory Program (MethodsLab)

Project Description

The MethodsLab program is a Java console-based application designed to demonstrate the proper use of methods in Java programming. The program consists of several tasks that showcase different types of methods, including methods with and without return values, methods with parameters, and methods that process arrays and perform mathematical operations.

The program interacts with the user through the console by accepting inputs and displaying results for each task.

Program Features / Tasks

Task 1: Greeting Method

* Displays a welcome message to the user
* Demonstrates a method without a return value

Task 2: Basic Arithmetic Calculator

* Accepts two numbers from the user
* Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using separate methods

Task 3: Factorial Calculation

* Accepts a number from the user
* Computes the factorial using a method and a loop

Task 4: Array Summation

* Uses a predefined integer array
* Calculates the sum of all elements using a method

Task 5: Prime Number Checker

* Accepts a number from the user
* Determines whether the number is prime using a method
